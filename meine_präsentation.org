* Introduction
** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:

- the first, very @important@, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.


The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:

*** Org mode increases productivity                               :B_theorem:
:PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
 
- org mode means not having to remember LaTeX commands.
- it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
- Emacs!

    

    
** Two columns

    :END:
 - this slide consists of two columns
 - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
 - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      @example@ block
